    \brief Understanding the basic concept of nymea plugins

    Plugins in nymea are used to expand the functionalitys and capabilitys of the nymea server. A plugin is basically a shared library,
    which will be loaded dynamically from the nymea server during the start up process. Each plugin has a \e name, a \e uuid and a
    list of supported \e vendors which will be visible in the system once the plugin is loaded. Each of thouse \l{Vendor}{Vendors} contains
    a list of supported \l{DeviceClass}{DeviceClasses}. A \l{DeviceClass} describes how the supported \l{Device} looks like, how it will be
    created (\l{DeviceClass::CreateMethod}{CreateMethod}), how the setup (\l{DeviceClass::SetupMethod}{SetupMethod}) looks like and what you
    can do with the \l{Device}.

    \section1 Devices
    A device in nymea can represent a real device, a gateway or even a service like weather. When you want to represent you own device / service in nymea, you should try to abstract that device and think in terms like:
    
    \list
        \li \l{ParamType}{ParamTypes} \unicode{0x2192} A \l{Device} can have \l{Param}{Params}, which will be needed to set up the device
            (like IP addresses or device configurations) and give information for the user like name or location. The \l{ParamType} represents
            the description of an actual \l{Param}.
        \li \l{StateType}{StateTypes} \unicode{0x2192} A \l{Device} can have \l{State}{States}, which basically represent a value of a \l{Device}
            like \e {current temperature} or \e ON/OFF. The \l{StateType} represents the description of an actual \l{State}.
        \li \l{EventType}{EventTypes} \unicode{0x2192} A \l{Device} can emit \l{Event}{Events}, which basically represent a signal.
            An example of an \l{Event} could be: \e {Button pressed}. An \l{Event} can have \l{Param}{Params} to give the possibility to pass
            information with the signal. The \l{EventType} represents the description of an actual \l{Event}.
        \li \l{ActionType}{ActionTypes} \unicode{0x2192} A \l{Device} can execute \l{Action}{Actions}, which represent basically
            a method for the \l{Device} which the user can execute. An example of an \l{Action} could be: \e {Set temperature}.
            An \l{Action} can have \l{Param}{Params} to give the possibility to parameterize the action. The \l{ActionType} represents
            the description of an actual \l{Action}.
    \endlist

    The \l{DeviceClass} represents the description of an actual \l{Device}.

    \section1 Hardware resources
    The \e libnymea provides a list of \l{Hardware Resources}{HardwareResources}, which can be used in every plugin. When sou start writing a plugin, you need to know which resource you will need. Each resource provides it's own interface for a \l{DevicePlugin}. In the plugin you don't have to take care about the resource.
